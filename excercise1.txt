1. Define the variables x and y as list of numbers, and z as a tuple.

   x=[1,2,3,4,5]
   y=[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
   z=(21, 22, 23, 24,25)

   (a) What is the value of 3*x? 
   (b) What is the valus of x+y? 
   (c) What is the value of x-y? 
   (d) What is the value of x[1]?
   (e) What is the value of x[0]?
   (f) What is the value of x[-1]?
   (g) What is the valus of x[:]?
   (h) What is the value of x[2:4]?
   (i) What is the value of x[1:4:2]?
   (j) What is the value of x[:2]?
   (k) What is the value of x[::2]?
   (l) What is the result of the following two expressions?
     
       x[3] = 8
       print x
   (m) What is tge result of the above pair of expressions if the list x 
       were replaced with the tuple z?

2. Define the variable s as the string s="abcd".

   (a) What is the value of 3*s?
   (b) What is the valus of s[1]?
   (c) What is the value of s[-1]?
   (d) What is the value of s[::2]?

3. Write a program to find those numbers i=100 that are equal to the sum 
   of their factors.
